# Privacy Policy for Reaw

**Last Updated**: May 13, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how **Reaw** (ID: 1370988836343250994), a Discord bot, collects, uses, stores, and protects user data. By using **Reaw**, you agree to the practices described in this policy and our [Terms of Service](/Reaw-Terms-of-Service-and-Privacy-Policy/terms-of-service.en). **Reaw** complies with the [Discord Developer Terms of Service](https://discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/developer-terms-of-service) and the [Discord Developer Policy](https://discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/developer-policy).

## 1. Data We Collect
We collect the minimum information necessary to operate **Reaw**:
- **Discord IDs**: User IDs (for DM subscriptions), server IDs, and channel IDs (for server subscriptions).
- **Subscription settings**: Notification type (anime or news), channel or DM for delivery, and language preferences (`es-ES` or `en-US`).
- **Interaction data**: Commands executed (e.g., `/activatesub`) and ephemeral responses, which are not stored permanently.
- **Technical data**: Log information for debugging (e.g., connection errors), which does not include personally identifiable information.

We do not collect personal information such as names, email addresses (except for those provided for donations), physical addresses, or any data not essential to the bot's functions.

## 2. Use of Data
We use the data to:
- Send notifications about new anime episodes or Crunchyroll news to subscribed channels or DMs.
- Manage subscriptions (e.g., enabling/disabling notifications).
- Detect and prevent abuse, such as misuse of commands.
- Improve the bot's performance, such as optimizing notification delivery.

## 3. Storage and Security
- Data is stored in a secure database managed by a trusted third-party provider, protected with encryption and access controls.
- Data is retained only while the subscription is active. When a subscription is deactivated (using `/deactivatesub` or `/deactivatesubdm`), the associated data is deleted.
- We take reasonable measures to protect data, but we cannot guarantee absolute security against unauthorized access. In the event of a data breach, we will notify affected users through our support server.

## 4. Sharing Data
We do not share data with third parties, except in the following cases:
- **Service providers**: We use trusted third-party hosting and storage services to operate the bot, and these comply with strict privacy policies.
- **Legal requirements**: We may disclose data if required by law or to protect our legal rights.
- **Consent**: With your explicit permission (e.g., if you provide data for support purposes).

## 5. User Rights
You can exercise the following rights:
- **Delete data**: Use `/deactivatesub` or `/deactivatesubdm` to delete your subscriptions and associated data.
- **Access data**: Request a copy of the data stored about you by contacting us.
- **Object to processing**: You can deactivate notifications at any time.
- For data requests, contact us via our support server or email (see section 6).

## 6. Minors
- **Reaw** is not intended for users under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect data from users under this age.
- If we discover that a user under 13 has provided data, we will delete it immediately.

## 7. Contact
For questions, data requests, or concerns about this policy, contact us:
- Support server: [https://discord.gg/DeCCNafkyh](https://discord.gg/DeCCNafkyh)
- Email: [sheltonlxn@gmail.com](mailto:sheltonlxn@gmail.com)

## 8. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy at any time. Changes will be posted on this page, and significant changes will be announced on our support server. The updated version takes effect upon posting.
